    <h1>Support Information</h1>
    <h2>Image not classifying correctly?</h2>
    <p>Remember that it is a machine learning model, with an accuracy of 88%, that classifies the mosquitoes. While infrequent, it is always possible that the model will incorrectly classify a mosquito.</p>
    <h2>Is the information on the app accurate?</h2>
    <p>Yes, all information in the app has been verified and edited by an industry professional from the National Environment Agency of Singapore.</p>
    <h2>Is the information provided medical?</h2>
    <p> <b>Absolutely not.</b> All information is simply about what conditions the mosquito generally breeds and bites in. It does not recommend any actions.</p>
    <h2>What types of photos are accepted?</h2>
    <p>Photos that are in the Photo Library, as accessed in the app can be passed in. No videos can be classified, but there is no option to pass in videos. Further, it is not possible to pass in photos from other sources (such as files or other photo storage sources)</p>
    <h2>Are any photos being stored?</h2>
    <p></p> <b>Absolutely not.</b> Photos are only temporarily accessed to be classified, they are never stored permanently.
