Understand the mosquitoes in your home and differentiate between different genera of mosquito with a simple click of your phone camera!

This app differentiates between 3 different genera of mosquitoes when users upload a picture of a mosquito found in their home. Using a machine learning model, the app classifies the mosquito as being Aedes, Anopeheles, Culex, or not a mosquito. Knowing the genus of the mosquito aids in understanding where it may be breeding in a home, thereby allowing users to address the issue from its root. 

The machine learning model has been trained on 5000+ images of mosquitoes of these three genera. It has an accuracy of 88%.
