    <h1>What is MozWatch?</h1>
    <p>MozWatch is an app that differentiates between 3 different genera of mosquitoes when users upload a picture of a mosquito found in their home. Using a machine learning model, the app classifies the mosquito as being Aedes, Anopheles, Culex, or not a mosquito. </p>
    <h1>Why it is useful?</h1>
    <p>Knowing the genus of the mosquito aids in understanding where it may be breeding in a home, thereby allowing users to address the issue from its root. Further, understanding when and where mosquitoes may bite allows users to protect themselves; for instance, by wearing mosquito repellant during certain times in the day.</p>
    <h1>How does the machine learning model work?</h1>
    <p>The machine learning model is an image classification model made with Apple's CreateML. The model has an accuracy of 88%, and was trained on 4000+ images of mosquitoes from the dataset from Pise, et al.</p>

    <h1>Is the information on the app accurate?</h1>
    <p>Yes, all information in the app has been verified and edited by an industry professional from the National Environment Agency of Singapore.</p>
